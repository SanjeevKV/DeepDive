After Lit Survey:
 - more sentence level works - many based on Phoenix, others individual datasets
 - planned to run baselines
     - How2Sign, only sentence level ASL dataset we could find, doesn't have gloss yet
     - searched for gloss, github mentions they planned to update in Mar 2022 - mailed them, they said it'll take time
     - Camgoz 2020
        - primary baseline, state-of-the-art to the best of our knowledge
        - using transformers
        - tries not to have gloss as intermediate representation (like most others) but uses it still (to guide the encoder)
        - can still be run without gloss - still better performance than previous end-to-end works (Camgoz 2018)
 - plan to consider Camgoz 2020 end-to-end version as the baseline
     - ran existing data (preprocessed features) provided by original authors
     - ran same without gloss
         - results decreased by about 1 BLEU from above (still the much better over Camgoz 2018 without gloss)

Ongoing:
 - running their architecture with AlexNet based features
     - initally run on Phoenix
     - follow by running on ASL (same preprocessing)

Upcoming:
 - working on running ASL on their architecture (end-to-end without gloss)
     - Phoenix dataset is domain specific (weather), this will help us see how a general dataset works on this architecture
 - freeze the encoder (on weights trained from Camgoz 2020 Phoenix with gloss), add layers and attempt transfer learning
     - experiment extending an encoder trained on one language's glosses on another language


******************* OTHER DETAILS *******************
Video Preprocessing:
 - first attempt: trying out AlexNet preprocessing with ImageNet weights:
     - download bvlc_alexnet.npy from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/ and keep in the same folder as the alexnet model
     - img2vec.py file runs the conversion
